Pairing Exercise

In this exercise you are tasked with creating a program that will calculate the total area of a collection of shapes.
A skeleton Java project has been set up for you with some source and test files.

The Problem:

XYZ Carpets want a program that will calculate the total area of shapes for which they create carpet pieces.  For simplicity,
the manager has said that each shape is always of a fixed constant dimension. This could change at a later iteration.
They only produce carpets in square, triangle and circle shapes.

The dimensions are as follows,
Square : 10 units
Triangle : base 10 units, height 10 units
Circle : radius 5 units

Assume that there are 5 circles, 8 squares and 4 triangles for this particular request.
